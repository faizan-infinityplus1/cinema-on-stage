                            Produced and directed by K. Asif, 'Mughal-e-Azam' (1960) boasted a sterling star cast
                            headlined by Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Madhubala, Ajit, Nigar Sultana and Durga Khote.
                            Asif spent over ten years battling production delays. A stickler for authenticity, he
                            ensured that even the pearls that were strewn in the path of Price Salim were real.
                            Craftsmen from all over the country were employed to build sets and embroider costumes.
                            Belgian mirrors were sourced for the Sheesh Mahal sequence and Asif spent more money on a
                            single-song sequence than the average budget of a film. He even paid an unheard amount to
                            classical vocalist Bade Gulam Ali Khan to sing two compositions. On its release,
                            'Mughal-e-Azam' broke box office records and remained the highest-grossing Indian film for
                            over 15 years. It set a benchmark in all aspects of filmmaking – Screenplay, Production
                            Design, Direction, Music, Dialogue, Performances, Cinematography et al and still exemplifies
                            peerless excellence. In 2004, its colorised version ran for over 25 weeks.

                    <p class="">Set in the reign of Emperor Akbar, the play infuses new life into the momentous love
                        story of Prince Salim and Anarkali. The passionate and forbidden love between the heir of the
                        Mughal empire and a court dancer throws the royal household into a tumult and brings Emperor
                        Akbar and Prince Salim face to face in a volcanic battle of wills. The play not only celebrates
                        the artistic legacy of one of the most enduring classics of Indian cinema but also showcases the
                        syncretic musical and dance traditions of India. Director Feroz Abbas Khan also explores class
                        conflicts and gender questions in the play even as he orchestrates war sequences, the regal
                        splendor and cultural richness of the Mughal era, with note-perfect dialogues and sumptuous
                        dance and music sequences. Watch as a series of dramatic events lead to a tragic climax and a
                        surprise end that leaves an unanswered question in its wake. At the heart of this lavishly
                        mounted, monumental play is a human story brimming with love, jealousy, rebellion, sacrifice,
                        and an ever-relevant message, “Dilwale ka saath dena, daulat wale ka nahin.” In the end, Salim
                        and Anarkali's passion remains unwavering, making their story one of the most beloved romances
                        in Indian cinema and theatre.

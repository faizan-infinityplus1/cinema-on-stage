has invited the legendary International cricket player Mr. Sanath Jayasuriya as
its chief guest on the event of the grand exhibition to be organized on the 9th
of April 2023. His presence is looked forward not only by the students, but
also the cricket fans of the whole valley. This will be a moment of pride for
the school to provide its students an opportunity to interact with such an
imminent sportsman. The exhibition will encompass all the departments and the
students will showcase the best of their project works. Mr. Jayasuriya, the
receiver of awards like ‘Best Batsman’ and ‘Best All-Rounder’ has made huge
contributions to the field of cricket. He has been an epitome of hard work,
dedication and perseverance throughout his career. His presence will surely
aspire many to pursue sports and even perform outstandingly in other walks of
life. &nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in; font-stretch: normal;" align="justify">Doon
School as an educational institute has believed in going beyond academics, for
the multi-faceted growth of its students. Taking this ethos forward, the school
last year invited Mr. Dave Watmore, the former Australian cricket player and
famous coach. As Mr. Watmore inaugurated school’s Wilmot Wing for L.P.D, he at
the same time was an inspiration to countless students of the school. &nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in; font-stretch: normal;" align="justify">Doon
School, has risen to prominence since its inception in 2014 by providing its
students various opportunities for their academic advancement as well as
